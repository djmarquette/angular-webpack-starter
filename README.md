# angular-webpack-starter

##Intro
This is an angular javascript file to help me learn how to bundle external modules 
using webpack.  The url can be found here: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/26017-2

There were some errors that needed correction, such as needing to include 
angular-sanitize and $sce when calling the github service.  I have also included
header blocks above each file so that you can easily find the correct code block 
when the file is bundled into app.bundle.js

## Next Steps
I'll need to convert this code to Typescript next, perhaps using TS-Loader to 
compile the source to javascript.  I'm sure I'll learn some things there, and then
apply this entire process to the angular 1.x Typescript demo I am creating for the 
brown-bag.

Be sure to save the code from that demo up to github so you can work on both
at work and at home.
